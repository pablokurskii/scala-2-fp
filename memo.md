use @tailrec with TAIL RECURSION approach for recursive functions, without storing intermediate information. see example

#7
use def calledByName(x: => Long): Unit = { to lazy call passed function, see example 

#9
S-interpolator - default s"$name some text ${1+2}"
F- to apply some formatting - f"$name $speed%2.2f" - see example
F- also works as a format validator at compile time

infix notation (ex. val1 method "string"), only allowed if method has only one parameter
